# INE Security eJPTv2 

The eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) is a penetration testing certification that tests practical skills in network and web application security, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation. 

To help clear some confusion around the versioning of this certification, this is the second version of the eJPT (hence eJPT
V2). 

It’s no longer under eLearnSecurity because eLearnSecurity was acquired by INE (Internetwork Expert). INE has rebranded and integrated eLearnSecurity’s certifications under its own platform. The exam and training remain, but they’re now managed and delivered by INE instead of the old eLearnSecurity brand. Hopefully that clears it up :)

## eJPTv2 Exam and Training Overview

The reccommened training featured on the INE website is the Penetration Testing Student learning path which consists of 153h of video to consume. As well as 108 different labs. Not all of these need to be completed (see below) as some are duplicate labs and some are just flat out not required. The training for the exam is broken up into 4 main sections 

- **Assessment Methodologies** – ⏱️ 25h  
- **Host & Networking Auditing** – ⏱️ 2h  
- **Host & Network Penetration Testing** – ⏱️ 113h  
- **Web Application Penetration Testing** – ⏱️ 9h  

The exam itself has a time limit of 48 hours and a set of 35 different question (multiple choice)

The exam is not meant to be a CTF but to simulate a real penetration test! 

To pass the eJPT, you must receive an overall exam score of at least 70%.
