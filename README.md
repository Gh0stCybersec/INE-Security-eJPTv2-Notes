# INE Security eJPTv2 

The eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) is a penetration testing certification that tests practical skills in network and web application security, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation. 

To help clear some confusion around the versioning of this certification, this is the second version of the eJPT (hence eJPT
V2). 

It’s no longer under eLearnSecurity because eLearnSecurity was acquired by INE (Internetwork Expert). INE has rebranded and integrated eLearnSecurity’s certifications under its own platform. The exam and training remain, but they’re now managed and delivered by INE instead of the old eLearnSecurity brand. Hopefully that clears it up :)
